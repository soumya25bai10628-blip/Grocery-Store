Managing grocery items manually becomes difficult as the inventory grows.  
Tasks such as adding items, updating stock, searching products, recording sales,  
and calculating bills can lead to errors when done by hand.

- Allows store owners/personnel to add, update, delete, and view items.
- Supports purchase and billing with automatic total calculation.
- Designed for small shops or basic inventory management demonstrations.
- Works offline and requires only Python to run.

## Target Users
- Small grocery shop owners.
- Students learning Python and file handling.
- Beginners creating Python mini-projects.
- Anyone needing a simple inventory/billing system.

## High-Level Features
- Add new grocery items into inventory.
- Display all stored items.
- Search for an item by name.
- Update price or quantity of existing products.
- Delete items from the inventory.
